This class is the epitome of our Fitbox methodology. Although it is a total body workout, each day focuses on two or three muscle groups to ensure muscle definition and toning in all the right places. This class uses all three training elements: cardio boxing, resistance/strength training, and Schwinn Airdyne Pro Fan Bikes. Every class is different and you will never plateau.\nThis class puts you in the right heart rate target zone and produces a “calorie afterburn effect” known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). EPOC is a process of increased metabolism for 24 to 36 hours after the workout. You will burn an average of 1000 calories per class.	2017-02-15 20:05:58.916243	2017-02-15 20:05:58.916243

This class is the epitome of our Fitbox methodology. Although it is a total body workout, each day focuses on two or three muscle groups to ensure muscle definition and toning in all the right places. This class uses all three training elements: cardio boxing, resistance/strength training, and Schwinn Airdyne Pro Fan Bikes. Every class is different and you will never plateau.\nThis class puts you in the right heart rate target zone and produces a “calorie afterburn effect” known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). EPOC is a process of increased metabolism for 24 to 36 hours after the workout. You will burn an average of 1000 calories per class.	2017-02-15 20:07:20.864136	2017-02-15 20:07:20.864136
